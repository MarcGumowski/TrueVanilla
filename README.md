# 🧭 TrueVanilla
## A Community Challenge Mode for World of Warcraft Classic

**TrueVanilla** is not just another addon — it’s a **gameplay philosophy**.

It aims to recreate a more authentic, mechanics-driven World of Warcraft Classic experience by removing modern crutches, meta tools, and exploitative optimizations.
Players who run this addon commit to playing the game closer to how it was designed:
with awareness, communication, teamwork, and exploration.

This addon does not make the game harder. 
It makes it *real* again.


# ⭐ Core Vision

Modern Classic gameplay is dominated by:

- Quest helpers (Questie)
- DBM and boss-callout addons
- DPS / threat meters
- World buff stacking
- Mass flasking
- PvP gear advantage in PvE
- Speedrunning and parsing meta

TrueVanilla offers an alternative:

```
A challenge mode that disables or discourages all these meta shortcuts, encouraging players to rely on the game’s mechanics — not addons or exploits.
````

This mode is ideal for:

- players who enjoy meaningful progression
- players tired of "solved content"
- players who want the authentic social/MMO feel
- guilds interested in a purist or experimental ruleset


# 🎮 Gameplay Rules (Challenge Mode)

Players who opt into TrueVanilla agree to the following rules:

## ❌ Addon Restrictions

- No quest helper addons (Questie, Guidelime, etc.)
- No boss-helper addons (DBM, BigWigs)
- No threat meters
- No DPS meters
- No automated tracking addons that remove thinking or awareness

TrueVanilla cannot programmatically disable other addons,
but it detects, reports, and flags non-compliant setups.

## ❌ World Buff Restrictions

- World buffs are not allowed
- Addon detects if they are applied
- Violations are broadcast to the group/guild

## ❌ Consumable Restrictions

- Flasks may only be used once every 2 hours
- Timer resets on death
- Violations are logged and shared

## ❌ PvP Gear Restrictions

- PvP gear cannot be used in PvE while participating in TrueVanilla
- Detection + automatic logging to the raid/group


# 🧩 Intended Gameplay Loop

1. Start a character on a Hardcore server
2. Level as normal (solo or with other TrueVanilla players)
3. If you die, transfer off
4. Continue playing under TrueVanilla rules
5. Only group/raid/guild with other TrueVanilla players
6. The addon ensures group purity and flags violations

This creates a post-Hardcore progression ecosystem
for purist players who don’t want the non-HC meta.

# 🛠 Current Features

- Addon presence/version checking across group/raid
- Detection of forbidden addons
- Warning system for non-compliant players
- World buff detection
- Flask cooldown enforcement
- PvP gear check
- Auto-sync of rule violations
- Group integrity verification

# 🔮 Planned Features

- Player death tracking
- Raid-wide death statistics
- Guild leaderboards
- Challenge "score" or progression
- Visual UI for compliance status
- Optional "Purity Badge" next to character names
- Exportable run logs for guilds

# ⚠️ What the addon cannot do (Blizzard restrictions)

TrueVanilla follows Blizzard’s addon API rules and therefore:

- ❌ cannot automatically disable other addons
- ❌ cannot remove buffs
- ❌ cannot equip/unequip gear
- ❌ cannot automatically kick players
- ❌ cannot block grouping at the engine level

Instead, it relies on:

- detection
- logging
- group verification
- community enforcement

Exactly like the original Hardcore addon did.

# 🤝 Community Enforcement

TrueVanilla works only for players who opt into the challenge.
Like the early Hardcore community, adherence is based on:

- transparency
- logging
- reputation
- guild norms

The addon ensures that groups/raids remain TrueVanilla-compliant.

If someone breaks the rules?
The addon makes sure everyone sees it.

# 💬 Philosophy Summary

```
TrueVanilla is not about making the game harder.
It’s about making the game honest.

- quest arrows
- trivialized mechanics

Then TrueVanilla is the challenge mode built for you.
